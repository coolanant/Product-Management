# Requirement

   Products are getting more sophisticated
2. In Order to make sure you get the right product and have the product done right.
 
## What ?
Requirements are specific descriptions of your client needs.

### Requirement Gathering vs Elicitation
Elicitation is just an act of getting reqirements from your client.
Eliciation is a much more involved, interactive & investigative process.

### Wants vs Needs
Needs - core functions required to solve the problem, that the product is intended to solve
Wants - desired function, they'd like to see
Needs > Wants
